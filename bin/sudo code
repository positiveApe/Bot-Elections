Ask the user how many bots we want to choose from
Returns the elected bot with a name that was taken from a name list that will be created/downloaded

Each bot is given an ID to track

Multiple passes are used to weed out the bots. 

Each pass all bots will vote on each individual bot, Yes/No

If a bot gets majority Yes, then it proceeds to the next round

A bot will need to know if it has been elected yet, if it failed/passed,
- what round it is in, how many

The main program will create a list of all the bots on the first pass
- it will deploy each bot to run against that list and collect their 
- election request. It will take the data, and create a new list with
- all the winning bots, and repeat the process.
